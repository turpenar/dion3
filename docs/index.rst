Flask-SocketIO
===============

**Flask-SocketIO** gives Flask applications access to low latency
bi-directional communications between the clients and the server. The
client-side application can use any of the `SocketIO <http://socket.io>`_
client libraries in Javascript, Python, C++, Java and Swift, or any other
compatible client to establish a permanent connection to the server.
